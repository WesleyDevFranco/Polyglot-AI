# Polyglot i+1 — AI-Powered Natural Language Learning

**Learn languages through stories tailored to what you already know.**

Polyglot i+1 is an AI-powered language learning application built around the **Natural Method** and the *i+1 principle*: learners acquire language by understanding content that is mostly familiar while encountering a small amount of new vocabulary.

Instead of relying exclusively on isolated word lists, Polyglot generates personalized stories based on your current proficiency level and known vocabulary. Each lesson introduces new linguistic elements in context, helping you build comprehension, vocabulary, and familiarity with the target language.

- Choose how answers appear on flashcards:
  - Full sentence translation.
  - Translation of the new linguistic element.
  - Definition in the target language.
- Track review statistics and reinforce vocabulary over time.

### 📊 Progress Tracking

- Track completed lessons and vocabulary growth.
- Review your learning history and revisit previous stories.
- Visualize vocabulary growth over time.
- Monitor study streaks and daily learning goals.
- Configure your preferred lesson size and study settings.

### 🌍 Language and Learning Preferences

Configure your target language, native language, proficiency level, and interface preferences.

**Available target languages and varieties include:**

- English
- Shakespearean English
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Italian
- Portuguese
- Japanese
- Chinese
- Russian
- Latin
- Modern Greek

The interface is available in English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.

### 💾 Local Data and Portable Backups

- Save your learning profile, known vocabulary, lesson history, and review progress locally.
- Export your data as a JSON backup.
- Import a previous backup to restore your progress.
- Transfer your learning data between devices by exporting and importing a backup.

Your learning data is designed to remain under your local control rather than relying on a mandatory cloud account.

## 🧭 The i+1 Principle

The core idea behind Polyglot is simple:

- **i** represents what you can already understand.
- **+1** represents a small amount of new language introduced within that familiar context.

A learner who understands most of a story can use context to infer unfamiliar words and expressions. Polyglot uses your known vocabulary and selected proficiency level to guide AI-generated lessons toward this approach.

The goal is to make language learning more contextual, personalized, and sustainable.

> Learn through comprehension. Build vocabulary through context. Reinforce what matters through repetition.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm.
- A Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ludoviciphilip/Polyglot-AI.git
cd Polyglot-AI
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL displayed by Vite in your terminal.

### Configure Gemini

1. Open the application.
2. Navigate to **Settings**.
3. Obtain an API key through [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
4. Enter and save your Gemini API key.
5. Configure your target language, native language, CEFR level, and known vocabulary.
6. Generate your first lesson.

The application uses Google's Gemini API to generate personalized stories and vocabulary review material. Story audio generation also uses Gemini when available.

**API usage:** Requests to Gemini are subject to Google's model availability, quotas, and applicable pricing. Check the current terms for your account before relying on a particular usage limit.

- **`App.tsx`** coordinates the main application, profile, lessons, history, and review workflow.
- **`components/`** contains the dashboard, study interface, settings, vocabulary tools, and spaced repetition experience.
- **`services/geminiService.ts`** handles AI-powered story generation and vocabulary review generation.
- **`utils/`** contains supporting utilities.
- **`types.ts`** defines the application's core data structures, user profile, lesson format, and review cards.

## 🔐 Privacy and Security

Polyglot is designed around local learning data and user-controlled backups.

- Learning preferences, vocabulary, and history are stored in browser-local storage.
- The Gemini API key can be saved locally and is included in exported JSON backups.
- AI features send requests to Google's Gemini API.

**Important security considerations:**

- Treat exported JSON backups as sensitive because they may contain your API key and personal learning data.
- Do not commit API keys to source control or share them publicly.
- Because the application calls Gemini from the browser, a key entered by a user should be treated as accessible to that browser environment. Local storage is not a secure secret vault.

## 🗺️ Project Status

Polyglot i+1 is an evolving project focused on contextual language acquisition, personalized learning, and long-term vocabulary retention.

AI-generated content may contain translation, grammar, pronunciation, or factual errors. Learners should use generated material as a study aid rather than as an infallible linguistic reference.

## 🤝 Contributing
